# spike-move

This game was originally my entry for Ludum Dare 44, but because I didn't have enough time, I wasn't able to submit it.  
In the game you are a creature that is on a hexagonal grid and needs to move to the goal, but many tiles on the floor hurt you when you step on them.

-----------------------

It's still WIP, but the source code will always be open source under the GNU GPLv3. 
Also  the name is really not final, this is the first thing I came up with. Pros would call this a codename.


---------------------------------

The GNU GPLv3 is in a nutshell, that if you use anything from this, your code needs to be the same license as this code.
